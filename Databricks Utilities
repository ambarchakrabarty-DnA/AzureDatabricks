# There are four types of Databricks utilities 
# 1. File System Utilities
       %fs
       ls

     dbutils.fs.ls ('/....filepath...')

     We can develop a for loop and print the files using dbutils command as follows:

     for files in dbutils.fs.ls('/....filepath.....'):
       print(files)

    We can add an if statement to the above for loop to filter out files we don't want as follows:

      for files in dbutils.fs.ls('/....filepath....'):
        if files.name.endswith ('...character....')
             print(files) 
      ## if we only want to see folder names then add print(files.name)

# 2. Widget Utilities
# 3. Secrets Utilities
# 4. Notebook Workflow Utilities
